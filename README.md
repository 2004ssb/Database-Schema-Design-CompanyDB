## üíæ SQL Script

SQL script (schema.sql) ‚Äì to create the database (CompanyDB), build the tables with primary and foreign keys, and insert sample records.
ER DAIGRAM

The chart depicts a corporation's worker management system. It illustrates how workers, departments, and the relationship within are set up.
1Ô∏è‚É£ Employee Entity
This entity stores all that individual information about an employee.
Some important notes:
All employees will have a unique id.
Basic information is included such as name, address, age, salary and title.
Also an attribute managerid will point to an employee id of another employee.
This identifies the reporting relationship for each employee - manager/supervisor.
There is an attribute depid that will associate an employee with the department where they primarily work.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Department Entity

This entity has the information about each department in the company.
deptid is the unique identifier.
deptname is the name of the department, such as HR or IT.
Location is the actual site of the department.
DeptHeadID indicates the employee who is head of that department.
This indicates the department can only have one employee associated as as department head.

3Ô∏è‚É£ EmployeeDepartment Entity

This is a relationship (junction) table.
It is needed because:
An employee can work in multiple departments, and
A department can have multiple employees.
To establish this many to many relationship, we store:
emplyeeid - which employee, 
depid - which department, 
startdate and enddate ‚Äì the period of time the employee worked in the department.
The id attribute is simply a unique key for each record.

Relationships Explained

Employee - Department: 
A department can have many employees. An employee can belong to more than one department through depid in Employee and the junction table (Table 2).

Employee - Employee (managerid): 
Shows the hierarchical reporting inside the company. An employee can be the manager of other employees.

Department - Employee (DeptHeadID): 

Indicates which employee is the head of the department.
